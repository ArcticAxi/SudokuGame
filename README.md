# Sudoku Game
Little sudoku puzzle that I made as a birthday gift. The original idea was to have encrypted texts that would only be decrypted after solving multiple sudokus. I quickly realised that this was a bit ambitious and decided to make only one sudoku, but there's a basic class structure to make adding more sudokus easier. The encryption/decryption functionality is there even though I ended up not adding it to the final game. I used the PyGame package for the UI elements and the cryptography package for the encryption.

Status: Bug in the sudoku checker crashes the game (even though it worked fine before).
