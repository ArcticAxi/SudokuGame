Ahoy! Thank ye fer findin' and readin' this here message! It means me signal has finally transmitted aft'r months o' tryin'. Even the fax machines have been strugglin' away in this here wasteland... I be needin' a favor from ye, ye scurvy dog! Please be so kind as to lend an old sea dog a hand and hear me out. Ov'r two decades ago, a good ol' matey o' mine wrote a sweet letter fer me 74th birthday. Although a bit old-fashioned, they gave me a letter written in a text file on a USB instead o' just sendin' a cursed email. To be honest with ye, I'd be likin' to simply read the letter again, for old times' sake. I can't remember what he wrote, me memory be fadin' 'cause o' Alzheimer's. Though I reckon I wouldn't have remembered it in me 20s either, the letter weren't that special. But I still be wantin' to read it. However, I accidentally dropped the USB in the ship's head and it stopped workin'. Luckily, I backed up the text file to a secure and encrypted cloud storage platform. Unluckily, I stashed the decryption key on the now broken USB and their customer support has been offline since the cursed meteorite struck. Luckily, afore that all happened, I had made me own Frankenstein monster, a game written in Python with 800 lines o' poorly scribbled code, which has the decryption key in there, somewhere. Unluckily, I can't find it. Luckily, playin' the game (equivalent to completin' a mighty total o' one sudoku), decrypts the text. Unluckily, I have ADHD and can't concentrate on the sudoku fer long enough to finish it. Luckily, I found ye! Please lend me a hand, dear kind matey. I be needin' to read me friend's letter again. Ye mustn't dally, hurry! Quick, off with ye! Enjoy!
